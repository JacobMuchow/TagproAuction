Will likely not play all of the matches on this connection though.", "reddit": "bsa86", "information": "In short; I'm the best. Right from the get-go, I was an instant majors superstar - capping from my very first grab in a majors match against peak Fat. In my next season I scored the highest GASP in a matchweek ever and then I carried Strategio to an MVB title. By this time it was common knowledge that I was something akin to the Thierry Henry of TagPro and so I was appointed captain by the greatest commissioner of all time, Carbon. After a spectacular season where I displayed my offensive prowess and secured the 2nd most amount of captures despite playing alongside Sheldon and having teammates who refused to take superboosts when instructed, we missed out in a final's place in what is unarguably  the most iconic moment in all of TagPro. It was in this moment that I realised that not only was I the greatest offender in the game, but I was also the greatest meme birthed by TagPro - everything I said, everything I did became a meme. I decided to use my powers for good, and became the voice of /r/TagPro community as well as commissioner of ELTP, fighting for the good of the game. At this point, I had ascended past my previous levels of skill. I removed the \"_\" from my name because I only know how to overscore, showcased perfectly in the final half of MLTP vs ELTP all-stars where I capped twice (2-0) and made the Americans not want to play us anymore by beating them on their own server. As this was happening, I drafted one of the strongest teams ELTP has ever seen - it just so happened that I had decided to do this in the season that THE strongest team ever was drafted and so was left in the shadows in what would otherwise have been my most dominant season to date. By late 2016, the TagPro community was paralysed with fear about the slow decay of the game that they loved, and so I set myself the task to save TagPro. As a result of my policies, the developers added TagPro to Kongregate and then decided to do the closest thing they could do to knighting me and recognised me as a 'Community Contributor'. My most recent season of competitive TagPro saw me, this time, struggle to save my team from the bottom half of the table. Alas, no amount of 'sick boosts' and shouting 'play anti' was enough, and mostly because of my team and definitely not because I'm washed, my weakest performance to date saw me prematurely leave in the Quarter Finals. For a month after this date, the name 'Berlin Ball' echoed throughout the corridors of Chord, the number of WAOT reports mysteriously dropped, and the player known as the 'Market God' was nowhere to be seen - lag and an overdose of Sea. salt had claimed this young ball in the prime of his career. Then, one day like the first blossom of spring, the unmistakable arseholeish tone of Berlin once again reappeared on Chord, however this time fainter than before, as he remained crippled with lag and it's harder to talk shit and get away with it when your rolling 300 is barely above Sword levels. Not to be beaten, this champion of caps, maker of memes, boost behemoth, and certified no-timers God would rise from the pits of his previous season, so that in one final hurrah he may win the league that has been just beyond his reach for so long.
